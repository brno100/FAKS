	Here is a video of the best player in the world.

	As of August 2019, Messi's all-time highlights for FC Barcelona:

	Appearances: 687
	Goals: 603
	Assists: 251
	Shot accuracy: 48 percent
	Chances created: 348

	FC Barcelona and Argentina
	Messi has only played for FC Barcelona, where he first signed at age 13. He also plays for the Argentina national team.

	By the age of 16, Messi made his first appearance for the FC Barcelona, putting himself in the record books on May
	1, 2005, as the youngest player to ever score a goal for the franchise. That same year, he led Argentina to the
	title in the under-20 World Cup, scoring on a pair of penalty kicks to propel the team over Nigeria.

	Messi steered Barcelona to a wealth of success, most notably in 2009, when the left-footer's team captured the
	Champions League, La Liga, and Spanish Super Cup titles. That same year, after two consecutive runner-up finishes,
	he took home his first FIFA "World Player of the Year" honor/Ballon d'Or award.

	Even the great Maradona gushed about his fellow countryman. "I see him as very similar to me," the retired player told
	the BBC. "He's a leader and is offering lessons in beautiful football. He has something different than any other player
	in the world."

	Amazingly, the soccer wizard continued to improve, discovering new ways to elude defenders while leading Barcelona to La Liga and Spanish Super Cup championships in 2010 and 2011,
	as well as the '11 Champions League title.

	Messi embarked on an all-out assault on the record books in 2012. He became the first player to score five goals in a Champions League match in early March, and a few weeks later
	he surpassed Cesar Rodriguez's club-record 232 goals to become Barcelona's all-time leading scorer.

	By the end of 2012, Messi had accumulated an astounding 91 goals in club and international play, eclipsing the 85 netted in a single calendar year by Gerd Muller in 1972. Fittingly,
	 he broke another record when he was named the FIFA Ballon d'Or winner for the fourth time in January 2013.

	The soccer great came back to earth somewhat that year due to the persistence of hamstring injuries, but he regained his record-breaking form by becoming the all-time leading scorer
	 in La Liga and Champions League play in late 2014.

	After helping Barcelona achieve a historic second treble in 2015, he was honored with his fifth FIFA Ballon d'Or trophy. Four years later, following another La Liga title, Messi again
	 established a new standard for excellence by claiming his sixth Ballon d'Or.

	Criticism for Argentina National Team Performance
	For all his success with Barcelona, Messi has come under fire for his inability to help Argentina's national team win a major title. He did lead "La Albiceleste" to the final
	 of the 2014 World Cup, and was named player of the tournament, although his team lost to Germany.

	In 2016, following Argentina's second consecutive loss to Chile in the final of the Copa America tournament, Messi announced he was ending his run with the national team.

	The soccer great eventually reversed his decision, but his participation in the 2018 World Cup did not bring that elusive title, as hoped. After Messi scored an early goal in a 2-1
	 win over Nigeria that helped his team advance from the group stage, he was largely kept in check by France, his two assists not enough to stave off a 4-3 defeat that sent Argentina
	 packing.

	The following year, after Messi heavily criticized the referees in the wake of a 2-0 loss to Brazil in the Copa America semifinals, the Argentine captain was slapped with a
	 three-game ban by the South American Football Confederation.
